Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton rolled up a series of big primary wins on Tuesday. 
Two presidential front-runners looked to take command of their party nominating battles on the 2016 campaign's biggest night of voting.
US networks projected Trump won five states and Clinton won six states on Super Tuesday, when 12 states were voting. 
Trump won Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee and Virginia, while Clinton won Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
But Ted Cruz, a US senator from Texas, won his home state and neighboring Oklahoma, stopping Trump's winning streak and giving hope to Republicans looking for a way to stop Trump's potential rise to the nomination.
Opinion polls heading into the voting had shown Trump leading in most of the 12 states up for grabs.
Raising the possibility of a big night that would intensify worries among Republican leaders who fear the billionaire could inflict long-term damage on the party.
Exit polls and early results showed Arkansas and Vermont were too close to call for Republicans, networks said. For Democrats, Massachusetts was too close to call.
Clinton, the former secretary of state, hoped to win enough states to take a big step toward wrapping up her nomination fight with rival Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist US senator from Vermont.
The stakes in this election have never been higher and the rhetoric we're hearing on the other side has never been lower, Clinton, 68, told supporters in Miami.
Beautiful Tree.
Trying to divide America between us and them is wrong, and we're not going to let it work.
Beautiful lady.
Beautiful landscape.
